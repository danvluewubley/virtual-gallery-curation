            <h5><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Starry-Night" target="_blank">The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh</a></h5>
            <p>
              The Starry Night depicts a dreamy interpretation of the artist's asylum room's sweeping view of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence at night, 
              although it was painted from memory during the day. The swirling night sky, the bright crescent moon, and the luminous stars are 
              juxtaposed against a quiet village and a massive, dark cypress tree in the foreground.
            </p>
            <h5>Fun Fact!</h5>
            <p>
              Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he was admitted 
              after a mental health crisis. The painting is often seen as a reflection of his turbulent state of mind.

            <p>
              The Last Supper depicts the moment Jesus announces that one of his twelve disciples will betray him. The painting captures the dramatic
               reaction of each apostle, showcasing Leonardo's mastery of human emotion and perspective. Jesus sits at the center of the long table, 
               with his disciples grouped in threes on either side.
            </p>
            <h5>Fun Fact!</h5>
            <p>
              Due to Leonardo's experimental technique and the conditions in the refectory, the painting began to deteriorate soon after its completion.
               Today, only a fraction of Leonardo's original work remains, with much of the surface having been restored or repainted.
